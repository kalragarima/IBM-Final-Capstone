This way the dataframe was reduced to only 5 columns containing the incident category and police district with their latitude and longitude values, which was then analyzed. \n\nThere was a lot of missing data in the dataframe which was then removed since a major chunk of data had missing values it did not make sense to fill the missing values with means of the given data. I only used data that had location information (geographical coordinates) in both the crime rate data as well as the location data provided by the San Fransico association of Realtors so that the combination of both the data gives us the meaningful information about the neighbourhoods of the city\n",
